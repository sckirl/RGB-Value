# RGB-Value

This project was planned to be used for LED light project. But it seems to be a bit more expensive to do than I thought. 
This project uses the Pillow library to get what's on the computer screen, and then openCV process it to get only a specific value. 

Users can change the coordinates of interest; with different hotkeys such as:

- right alt -> change the position of the area of interest

- right ctrl -> lock the position

Demo

from that video, the red rectangle is the area of interest, that user can change and lock.
